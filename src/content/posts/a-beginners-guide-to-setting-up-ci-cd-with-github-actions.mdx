description: I wrote an article explaining how to setup CI/CD with Github Actions.
---

If you are reading this, you or your team probably need a way to run automatic tests, build, deliver and deploy projects faster, well worry no more this is where continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) with Github Actions comes in. But hold on what does CI/CD mean?

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It‚Äôs a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery is when your code is always ready to be released but isn‚Äôt pushed to production unless you make the decision to do so. It is a manual step. With Continuous Deployment, any updated working version of the app is automatically pushed to production.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment is the process by which qualified changes in software code or architecture are deployed to production as soon as they are ready.

## Examples of Tools to Use to Perform CI/CD

There are numerous tools to configure and perform CI/CD processes:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
- [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/)
- [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)
- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [CodeShip](https://codeship.com/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a tool that makes it easy to automate software workflows and handles CI/CD processes, [introduced in October 2018](https://github.blog/2018-10-17-action-demos/), launched in beta in August 2019, and finally distributed in November 2019, GitHub Actions is also paid, although it has a free version with some limitations.

## Example of Using Github Actions In a Project

For this example, we would be using [React Js (Create React App) starter project](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for demonstration purposes.

![React Starter](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZKPG5z31d38zvqQdyb8Mkg.png)

First, we need to enter our GitHub project and access the Actions tab:

![Github Actions Tab](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FNBfF0r7HnJNF-GrgQ6NCg.png)

We arrive at a screen that allows us to choose between a predefined workflow or an established workflow, In our case, we‚Äôll be using an established workflow.

![Set Up Workflow](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*06QKpxsQW8gArPUWQsEfNQ.png)

Notice the workflow in the file called main.ymlwhich is in .github/workflows/ below, this is the default workflow that Github gives us when we establish our own workflow. We can have different files with different workflows.

![main.yml](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*rD2bCj5ahW--4DbafMWHjg.png)

Now we‚Äôll change the content of the file.

```
name: Lint
on: push
jobs:
  run-linters:
    name: Run linters
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node: [13.x, 14.x, 15.x]
    steps:
      - name: Check out Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup node env üèó
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Install dependencies üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run linter üëÄ
        run: npm run lint
```

## ‚Äòname‚Äô

It‚Äôs a label for our workflow.

## ‚Äòon‚Äô

Github executes workflows that are defined with the `on` key ‚Äî in our case, any `push` event. We can also define a specific branch. For example, `push` events in the master branch:

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

## ‚Äòjobs‚Äô

Each workflow is made up of one or more `jobs`. In our case, there‚Äôs only one.

## ‚Äòruns-on‚Äô

This parameter contains the type of virtual machine in which the code will be executed. In this case, we‚Äôll use `ubuntu-latest`(To see the different types of virtual machines available).

## ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô and ‚Äòmatrix‚Äô

A `strategy` creates a `matrix` of environments in which to execute the work. Each `matrix` allows us to establish a set of different configurations of the virtual environment.

## ‚Äòsteps‚Äô

A step is a sequence of tasks. In the example we‚Äôre seeing, the first step is to check the repository that triggered the push event so the workflow can access it.

```
- name: Check out Git repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

In the second step, the workflow is set up with a version of node.js to execute the application.

```
- name: Setup node env üèó
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.2
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

In the third step, the workflow installs all our dependencies that are needed for our application with the `npm ci` command, for more information on the command I highly recommend you check the [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci).

```
- name: Install dependencies üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
  run: npm ci
```

Finally, we have arrived at the last step.

In the last step, we use the linter tool which is a tool that analyzes our code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and overall helps to improve our code.

```
- name: Run linter üëÄ
  run: npm run lint
```

Whenever we push code to our repository this workflow will run, when we access the Actions tab of the repository again, we can see a list of the times the workflow has been executed. In this case, if no error has occurred, we obtain the following:

## Conclusion

[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is one of the best ways to create and maintain a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow, it's definitely a feature that is worth getting excited about. It facilitates easier development workflow by handling a number of steps.
